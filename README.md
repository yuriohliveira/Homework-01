Homework 01 - Code Refactor

Motivation: A poorly written code given to the student for reviewing wrong and not optimal parts of the code. From aesthetics to actual mistakes, the student was supposed to take a look, use all the knowledge obtained so far in the course and do It`s best to correct it.

It was a good way to put the student in the place of the poor teacher that needs to deal with that kind of ugly codes, but mainly, a good way to understand the importance that an organized and clean code have, because It gets much easier to understand possible mistakes and to correct them.

A few features:

Website title changed to Horiseon.
Changed main color to purple.
Added a Frank Zappa picture.
Resized original image.
Corrected a few images that didn't have "alt" and functions that weren't working properly. 
General cleaning and improving aesthetics of the code that was poorly writen.
Redundant parts of the code were grouped, some "divs" were turned into "header" and "footer".
Added "class" to missing images.
